      "question": "Q1. The number of steps in which designing of forming process can be divided are:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "5",
        "b": "3",
        "c": "2",
        "d": "8"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Forming process design is typically divided into 5 major steps.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The process involves more than 3 steps.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Only 2 steps is too few for forming design.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Industrial practice generally uses 5 steps, not 8."

      "question": "Q2. Which of the following product is not manufactured by forming operation:",

        "c": "Crankshaft",
        "d": "Lathe bed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Fasteners can be made by cold heading (a forming process).",
        "b": "Incorrect. Many hand tools are drop forged.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Crankshafts are commonly manufactured by forging.",
        "d": "Correct. Lathe beds are typically made by casting, not forming."

      "question": "Q3. Which of the following is an advantage of forging:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Good surface finish",
        "b": "Low tooling cost",
        "c": "Close tolerance",
        "d": "Improved physical property"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Surface finish is generally not the best in forging.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Forging usually has high tooling cost.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Forging provides moderate tolerance, not the best.",
        "d": "Correct. Forging improves mechanical strength due to grain flow."

      "question": "Q4. Which one of the following may not be the variable that affect the metal forming process:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Billet material property",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Material properties strongly affect forming.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Ram speed is a major forming variable.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Lubrication is a key process variable.",
        "d": "Correct. Surface lustre does not affect forming mechanics."

    {
      "question": "Q5. In forging operation fullering is done to:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Draw out material",
        "b": "Bend the materials",
        "c": "Upset the materials",
        "d": "Extrude the material"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Fullering spreads material outward to draw it out.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Bending is a separate forming operation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Upsetting increases cross-section, opposite of fullering.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Extrusion is not related to fullering."
