      "question": "The process of removing the burs or flash from a forged component in drop forging is called:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Swaging",
        "b": "Perforating",
        "c": "Trimming",
        "d": "Fetting"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Swaging shapes material but does not remove flash.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Perforating is punching a hole.",
        "c": "Correct. Trimming removes flash after drop forging.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Fetting is not used for flash removal."

      "question": "Which of the following material cannot be forged:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Wrought iron",
        "b": "Cast iron",
        "c": "Mild steel",
        "d": "High carbon steel"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Wrought iron is highly forgeable.",
        "b": "Correct. Cast iron is brittle and cannot be forged.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Mild steel is commonly forged.",
        "d": "Incorrect. High carbon steel can be forged with temperature control."

      "question": "The forging defect due to hindrance to smooth flow of metal in component called lap. It occurred due to:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The corner radius provided is too large",
        "b": "The corner radius provided is too small",
        "c": "Draft is not provided",
        "d": "The shrinkage allowance is inadequate"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Large corner radius does not cause laps.",
        "b": "Correct. Too small corner radius obstructs flow and causes laps.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Lack of draft causes sticking, not laps.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Shrinkage allowance relates to casting, not forging laps."

      "question": "In valve forging simulation of multi-step forging, the number of steps required for valve forging are:",

        "a": "Incorrect. Valve forging requires more than 2 steps.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The actual number is higher.",
        "c": "Incorrect. It does not require 5 steps.",
        "d": "Correct. Valve forging typically uses 4 steps in simulation."
